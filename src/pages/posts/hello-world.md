So.. This is it. Again. Another developer is deciding to write about code. Yeah There's so much more than code of course. So I am starting this blog to write about.. code of course.. and a bit of life, parenting, mistakes, failures, learnings, successes.. and just writing..

And also I will be experimenting with this static site builder called [Astro](https://astro,build/). I will be posting about improvements and learnings I will be doing.

So let's build and learn!
